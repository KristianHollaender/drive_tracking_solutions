 # Drive Tracking Solutions

Drive Tracking Solutions is a project aimed at facilitating truck drivers in keeping track of their driving hours on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. It also provides features for setting checkpoints during a tour and monitoring resting times.

## Features
 - Track driving hours on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.
 - Set checkpoints during a tour.
 - Monitor resting times.


## Flutter App

The primary focus of this project is a mobile app built using the Flutter Framework. The app offers a user-friendly interface for truck drivers to track their driving hours and manage checkpoints. It utilizes a Firebase backend for data storage and synchronization.

## Web application

In addition to the mobile app, this project includes an admin page designed for administrators to monitor the driving activities of individual truckers. The admin page provides insights into their driving hours, locations visited, and adherence to required rest periods.

The web application is built using the Angular Framework and utilizes the same Firebase backend as the Flutter app for seamless data integration.
