 # Drive Tracking Solutions

This project makes it easier for truck drivers to keep track of how much they have driven on a given day/week/month, set checkpoints doing a tour and keep track of resting times.


## Flutter App

The primary focus of this project is an app, made using the Flutter Framework, in combination with a Firebase backend. 
## Web application

This project also consist of an admin page, that allows administrators to see how much each trucker is driving, where they have been, and if they are taking the required pauses. 

The web application uses the same Firebase backend as the Flutter app. 

The admin page is made using the Angular Framework.
